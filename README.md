Password - Generator


## Description
 The foloowing pjoect was to create a random pasword -generator that owuld inlcude
  all characters and special caracters that is at least 8 characters long
 and no more that 128. In this project I learned how to use a javascript for loop. How to 
 create functions that were working properly. Also using choiceArray for the first time.
  The CSS and html was already included from the start.

 ## Installation
 First code I added were my variables that I needed such as how long needed 
 the chasracters to be for the password, the variety of ways I can type
 the characters such as using capital letts or number by creating strings. I added
 another function to create a series of prompts that asks for the character lenghth instructing
 ho many characters it needs. Also code the propmpt to alert user if they did not pick the certain 
 of characters. Then I added if statements for the upper, lower case, special characters and 
 the choice of numbers in your password. For the section where I wrote the password I 
 created the answer for the user to answr true or false for the right prompts given. To
 make the password I made an empty string, then used a for loop for the character length based 
 on how the user andswers the prompts. I ussed Math. random multipilied by choice array with a randomIndex for the variables.
